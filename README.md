# MySQL_Project_Product_Tracking_System
I have several header functions in php files, which follow my own route. 
I submitted file name is project-WenyiLiu, all my php files are stored in: 
project-WenyiLiu/src folder Under C:/php folder.

So, my header location route is: 
Localhost:8080/project-WenyiLiu/src/fileName.php
The header function is used to rollback to information page before user has entered all required items. Or direct to error massage page canâ€™t find the machine or app ID

If you want to change the route, you can find the header function at (they all at the end of the file):
1.	indexResult.php 			line 131
2.	appResult.php 			line 73 and line 130
3.	hardwareResult.php 			line 96 and line 203
If you need to use search to find the function, please search: project-WenyiLiu
